Here are the steps to see the details:

1. List all Pods in the kube-system Namespace:
This command lists all the Pods running in the kube-system namespace, where Kubernetes system components typically run.

kubectl get pods -n kube-system
2. View Detailed Information about a Specific Pod:
You can get detailed information about a specific Pod, such as the API server, controller manager, or etcd, by using the kubectl describe pod command.

For example, to get details about the API server Pod:

kubectl describe pod <api-server-pod-name> -n kube-system
To find the name of the API server Pod, you can look at the output from the first command. Similarly, you can get details for the controller manager and etcd Pods.

3. Example Commands:
API Server

First, find the name of the API server Pod:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep kube-apiserver
Then, describe the API server Pod:

kubectl describe pod <api-server-pod-name> -n kube-system
Controller Manager

Find the name of the controller manager Pod:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep kube-controller-manager
Then, describe the controller manager Pod:

kubectl describe pod <controller-manager-pod-name> -n kube-system
etcd

Find the name of the etcd Pod:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep etcd
Then, describe the etcd Pod:

kubectl describe pod <etcd-pod-name> -n kube-system
4. View Logs for Detailed Insights:
To get more detailed operational information, you can view the logs of these components. For example, to view the logs of the API server:

kubectl logs <api-server-pod-name> -n kube-system
Similarly, you can view logs for the controller manager and etcd Pods:

kubectl logs <controller-manager-pod-name> -n kube-system
kubectl logs <etcd-pod-name> -n kube-system
5. Check Cluster Component Status:
To get an overview of the status of the cluster components, you can use:

kubectl get componentstatuses
